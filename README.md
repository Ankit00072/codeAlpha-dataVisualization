# CodeAlpha - Data Visualization Project

This project is part of my **Data Analytics Internship** with [CodeAlpha](https://www.codealpha.tech), focusing on transforming raw scraped data into meaningful visual insights that support business decisions.

# Task 3: Data Visualization — Books Dataset

After scraping book details (from [books.toscrape.com](http://books.toscrape.com)) in Task 1, I created visualizations to explore pricing patterns, availability trends, and customer ratings.



# Tools & Libraries Used

- `pandas` – data loading and cleaning  
- `matplotlib` – plotting  
- `seaborn` – statistical visualizations  



# Visualizations Created

1. **Star Rating Distribution**  
   → Reveals the most common book ratings (1–3 stars dominate).

2. **Price Distribution**  
   → Most books are priced between **£20–£40**, indicating a mid-range catalog.

3. **Availability Count**  
   → Most books are "In stock," showing good inventory levels.


# Data Story

These visualizations help answer strategic questions:
- 📉 Are customers satisfied with the catalog? (Mostly average ratings)
- 💸 Are prices aligned with value? (Price ≠ Rating)
- 📦 Can customers rely on book availability? (Yes, inventory looks stable)

This analysis helps inform decisions around product curation, pricing strategy, and customer engagement.
